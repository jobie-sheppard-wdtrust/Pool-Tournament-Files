Pool Tournament Web App Project Plan

1) Project Goals
- Build a web application to manage pool tournaments end-to-end.
- Support player registration, bracket generation, match tracking, and standings.
- Provide a simple public view for participants and spectators.

2) Core User Roles
- Admin: creates tournaments, manages players, records match results.
- Player: registers and views schedule/results.
- Spectator: views bracket, live results, and leaderboard.

3) MVP Scope
- Tournament creation form (name, date, format, race length, venue).
- Player registration and roster management.
- Single-elimination bracket generation (with optional seeding).
- Match result entry and automatic bracket advancement.
- Standings/results page.
- Basic authentication for admin actions.

4) Post-MVP Enhancements
- Double-elimination and round-robin formats.
- Handicap support and custom scoring rules.
- Notifications (email/SMS) for upcoming matches.
- Mobile-friendly score entry.
- Export to PDF/CSV and shareable public links.

5) Suggested Technical Approach
- Frontend: responsive web UI with clear bracket and match cards.
- Backend: REST API for tournaments, players, matches, and standings.
- Database: relational schema for users, tournaments, players, rounds, matches.
- Auth: session or token-based admin authentication.

6) Data Model (High Level)
- users: id, name, email, role, password_hash.
- tournaments: id, title, format, start_date, venue, status.
- players: id, tournament_id, display_name, seed, handicap.
- matches: id, tournament_id, round, table_number, player_a_id, player_b_id, winner_id, status.
- standings: id, tournament_id, player_id, wins, losses, points.

7) Milestones
- Milestone 1: Requirements finalization and wireframes.
- Milestone 2: Backend API + database schema.
- Milestone 3: Frontend MVP pages (admin + public views).
- Milestone 4: Bracket logic and result progression.
- Milestone 5: QA, bug fixes, and deployment.

8) Timeline (Example 6 Weeks)
- Week 1: Requirements, UX flow, technical design.
- Week 2: Database and authentication.
- Week 3: Tournament/player management features.
- Week 4: Bracket generation + match workflow.
- Week 5: Public pages, polish, and responsive improvements.
- Week 6: Testing, deployment, and documentation.

9) QA & Validation
- Unit tests for bracket generation and advancement logic.
- API tests for CRUD operations and auth-protected routes.
- Manual end-to-end flow: create tournament -> register players -> run matches -> publish results.

10) Deployment & Operations
- Deploy app and database with environment-based configuration.
- Add logging, error monitoring, and daily database backups.
- Prepare admin guide and quick-start documentation.

11) Success Criteria
- Admin can run a full tournament without manual bracket handling.
- Players/spectators can view accurate, up-to-date match outcomes.
- MVP supports reliable operation for live event usage.
